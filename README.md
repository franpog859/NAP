# NAP

## Description

NAP is an Android app specially designed for astronauts but for sure everyday man could use it as well. It is basically an alarm clock. 

Couple of years ago I read in some popular science article that astronauts from NASA keep taking naps for exactly 26 minutes (in fact I do not remember if there were 26 or 24 but two minutes extra is not a disaster I think)! It was something about sleep phases and there was huge amount of science behind this decision. I tried it and since then all my naps take exactly 26 minutes!

All of the sounds are taken from the [NASAs site](https://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/index.html). If you can see some drama, some obvious bug or some bad habit tell me! I would be very glad if you do. It is all about learning.

It is an Android Studio project, so if you want to run it you should import it as a new project in your IDE and build it.

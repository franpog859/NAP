## Description

NAP is an Android app specially designed for astronauts but for sure everyday man could use it as well. It is basically an alarm clock.

Couple of years ago I read in some popular science article that astronauts from NASA keep taking naps for exactly 26 minutes (in fact I do not remember if there were 26 or 24 but two minutes extra is not a disaster I think)! It was something about sleep phases and there was huge amount of science behind this decision. I tried it and since then all my naps take exactly 26 minutes!

## What does it do?

App takes care about everything. You should only tap the icon, take a nap and it will do its job. NAP should:
- [x] set the 26 minutes alarm
- [x] take care about the sounds volume 
- [x] start the counting down intro sound
- [x] inform you that everything is fine
- [x] wake you up after 26 minutes with some NASA radio sounds

## Future plans

- [ ] Turn off every disturbing media before setting the alarm (and maybe treat it as a real alarm not a ordinary media)
- [ ] Set the airplane mode and turn it off after alarm cancellation
- [ ] Set the notification counting down every second until the alarm is triggered and close it after app stopping
- [ ] Turn the screen off and block the phone after the end of starting counting down
- [ ] Test the app not only manually 
- [ ] Add some extraordinary UI with some rounded buttons and other lovely stuff
- [ ] Add little button with the donate option and integrate it with the PayPal account
- [ ] Add little button linking to the open source repository
- [ ] Deploy it and share with friends

## How to build it?

It is an Android Studio project, so if you want to run it you should import it as a new project in your IDE and build it.

All of the sounds are taken from the [NASAs site](https://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/index.html). If you can see some drama, some obvious bug or some bad habit tell me! I would be very glad if you do. It is all about learning.
